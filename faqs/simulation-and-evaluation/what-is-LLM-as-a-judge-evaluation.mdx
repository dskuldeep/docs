### Maxim AI’s LLM as a Judge Implementation

Maxim AI provides robust LLM-as-a-judge evaluation with:

- **Flexible Judge Configuration**: Define custom evaluation criteria and judge prompts tailored to your specific requirements.

- **Multi-Model Support**: Use different LLMs as judges (GPT-4, Claude, etc.) and compare their assessments.

- **Automated Execution**: Run LLM evaluations automatically across your test sets and production traffic.

- **Structured Outputs**: Extract and visualize judgment scores, categories, and explanations for easy analysis.

- **Consistency Monitoring**: Track how judge assessments perform over time and identify evaluation drift.

LLM as a Judge enables teams to evaluate AI outputs at scale with human-like judgment, making quality assurance practical and continuous.

### Best Practices for LLM as a Judge

- **Start with Clear Criteria**: Define exactly what you’re evaluating before designing judge prompts.

- **Validate Against Humans**: Compare LLM judgments to human evaluations on a sample set to ensure alignment.

- **Use Stronger Models**: More capable models (GPT-4, Claude) generally provide better judgments than smaller models.

- **Implement Quality Checks**: Randomly audit LLM judgments to catch systematic errors or drift.

- **Combine Multiple Judges**: For critical evaluations, use multiple LLM judges or combine LLM judgment with automated metrics.
