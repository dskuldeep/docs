title: "What is AI agent evaluation?"
description: "Evaluation is how you systematically measure and improve the quality and performance of your AI agents. 
<br/>
<br/>
Maxim AI provides end-to-end evaluation across the entire agent development lifecycle, from prototype to production."
---

- **Pre-Production Evaluation ([Offline Evaluation](https://www.getmaxim.ai/docs/offline-evals/overview))**: Before deployment, teams can evaluate their AI agents using curated datasets or simulated real-world scenarios across different user personas. 
- **In-Production Evaluation ([Online Evaluation](https://www.getmaxim.ai/docs/online-evals/overview))**: Assess AI performance in real-time at different granularities to maintain quality and reliability in production.

By supporting both offline and online evaluations, Maxim enables you to ship AI agents with the quality and speed required for real-world use.
