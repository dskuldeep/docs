- **Pre-Production Evaluation ([Offline Evaluation](https://www.getmaxim.ai/docs/offline-evals/overview))**: Before deployment, teams can evaluate their AI agents using curated datasets or simulated real-world scenarios across different user personas. 
- **In-Production Evaluation ([Online Evaluation](https://www.getmaxim.ai/docs/online-evals/overview))**: Assess AI performance in real-time at different granularities to maintain quality and reliability in production.

By supporting both offline and online evaluations, Maxim enables you to ship AI agents with the quality and speed required for real-world use.
