title: "How can I Detect Hallucinations in My AI Applications?"
description: "AI hallucinations occur when language models generate information that sounds plausible but is factually incorrect, not supported by the provided context, or entirely fabricated. These hallucinations undermine trust in AI systems and can cause serious problems when users rely on inaccurate information."

### Maxim AI’s Hallucination Detection Capabilities

Maxim AI provides comprehensive tools to detect and prevent hallucinations:

- **Automated Detection**: Run hallucination detection checks automatically on production traffic or test datasets.

- **Context Grounding Analysis**: Verify that responses are properly grounded in provided context and retrieved documents.

- **Multi-Method Detection**: Combine context comparison, external validation, and LLM-based evaluation for comprehensive coverage.

- **Alert Configuration**: Set up alerts when hallucination rates exceed acceptable thresholds.

- **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify patterns in when and why hallucinations occur to target prevention efforts.

By implementing robust hallucination detection, you can catch and correct false information before it reaches users, maintaining the reliability and trustworthiness of your AI application.
