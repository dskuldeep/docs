## Offline Evaluation: Testing Before Deployment

Offline evaluation enables you to test agents against curated datasets or simulated scenarios before they face real users. 
Maxim supports multiple methods for this:

### Agent Simulation

[Agent simulations](https://www.getmaxim.ai/docs/simulations/text-simulation/simulation-runs) are the most effective way to test conversational agents. Instead of static input-output pairs, simulations create dynamic interactions between your agent and a user persona to test multi-turn capabilities.

- **Define Personas:** Configure user characteristics (e.g., "impatient customer," "technical user") to test how the agent adapts.
- **Set Scenarios:** Define the user's goal (e.g., "Process a refund") and the [expected steps](https://www.getmaxim.ai/docs/simulations/text-simulation/simulation-runs#expected-steps) the agent should take.
- **Validate Context:** Ensure the agent retains information across multiple exchanges.

### HTTP Endpoint Evaluation

If your agent is hosted externally, you can use [HTTP Endpoint Evaluation](https://www.getmaxim.ai/docs/offline-evals/via-ui/agents-via-http-endpoint/quickstart). This enables you to send payloads to your agent’s API endpoint and evaluate the response without code changes.

- **Configuration:** Connect Maxim to your agent's URL.
- **Payloads:** Map your test dataset columns to your API's input schema (e.g., mapping a `question` column to your API's `messages` body).
- **Multi-turn Support:** Configure the endpoint to handle conversation history for realistic stateful testing.

### No-Code & Dataset Evaluation

Test your agentic workflows with Datasets and Evaluators in minutes using the [No-Code Agent Builder](https://www.getmaxim.ai/docs/offline-evals/via-ui/agents-via-no-code-builder/quickstart). Alternatively, if you have pre-generated logs, use [Dataset Evaluation](https://www.getmaxim.ai/docs/offline-evals/via-ui/advanced/dataset-evaluation) to score existing outputs without re-running the agent.

## Online Evaluation: Monitoring in Production

Once deployed, use [Online Evaluation](https://www.getmaxim.ai/docs/online-evals/overview) to monitor agent performance in real-time. Maxim uses [Distributed Tracing](https://www.getmaxim.ai/docs/tracing/overview) to capture the hierarchy of agent operations:

- **Sessions:** Evaluate the full multi-turn conversation (e.g., "Did the user achieve their goal?").
- **Traces:** Evaluate individual interactions or turns within a session.
- **Spans:** Evaluate specific steps, such as a Retrieval (RAG) step or a [Tool Call](https://www.getmaxim.ai/docs/library/evaluators/pre-built-evaluators/statistical-evaluators/tool-call-accuracy).


<Tip> You can configure [Alerts](https://www.getmaxim.ai/docs/online-evals/set-up-alerts-and-notifications) to notify you via Slack or PagerDuty if quality scores drop below your defined threshold.</Tip>
## Automating Evaluations with the SDK

For Continuous Integration (CI/CD), use the Maxim SDK to trigger evaluations programmatically. The following example demonstrates running a test for an agent:

```python
from maxim import Maxim

# Initialize the client
maxim = Maxim({"api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY"})

# Trigger a test run
result = (
    maxim.create_test_run(
        name="Weekly Agent Regression",
        in_workspace_id="YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID"
    )
    # Map dataset columns to your agent's inputs
    .with_data_structure({
        "input": "user_query",
        "context": "retrieved_docs",
        "expected_output": "ground_truth"
    })
    # Link to your existing dataset and prompt version
    .with_data("dataset-id-uuid")
    .with_prompt_version_id("prompt-version-uuid")
    # Attach evaluators
    .with_evaluators(
        "Answer Relevance",
        "Tool Call Accuracy",
        "Hallucination"
    )
    .run()
)

print(f"Test Run Completed. Results: {result.test_run_result.link}")

```

## Evaluators

Maxim supports various types of evaluators. You can use pre-built evaluators from the evaluator store or build your own custom evaluators according to your specific use case.

| Evaluator Type | Description | Examples | Documentation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **AI Evaluators** | Uses LLMs to judge subjective quality | Faithfulness, Hallucination, Tone | [AI Evaluators](https://www.getmaxim.ai/docs/library/evaluators/pre-built-evaluators/ai-evaluators/overview) |
| **Statistical Evaluators** | Standard ML metrics for text comparison | BLEU, ROUGE, Exact Match | [Statistical Evaluators](https://www.getmaxim.ai/docs/library/evaluators/pre-built-evaluators/statistical-evaluators/overview) |
| **Programmatic Evaluators** | Code-based assertions (JS/Python) | JSON schema validation, Regex checks | [Programmatic Evaluators](https://www.getmaxim.ai/docs/library/evaluators/pre-built-evaluators/programmatic-evaluators/overview) |
| **Human Evaluators** | Manual review by domain experts | Expert review, RLHF annotation | [Human Annotation](https://www.getmaxim.ai/docs/offline-evals/via-ui/prompts/human-annotation) |

## Building Custom Evaluators

While pre-built evaluators cover common use cases, **Custom Evaluators** are essential for validating domain-specific business rules and proprietary logic. Maxim allows you to build these tailored evaluators in the following ways:

#### Custom AI Evaluators (LLM-as-a-Judge)
Use this when you need to evaluate subjective criteria specific to your domain (e.g., "Is this response compliant with our brand voice?").

- **Configuration:** You select the judge model (e.g., GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet) and define the **Evaluation Instructions** in the Definition Tab.
- **Scoring Options:** Configure the output as **Binary** (Pass/Fail), **Scale** (1-5), or **Categorical** (e.g., "Compliant", "Minor Violation", "Critical Violation").
- **Best For:** Nuances that require reasoning, such as medical advice safety or legal disclaimer checks.

#### Custom Programmatic Evaluators
Use this for deterministic, logic-based checks that code can handle better than an LLM.

- **How it works:** Write a `validate` function in **Python** or **JavaScript** directly in the Maxim UI.
- **Logic:** You can use regex to validate formats (e.g., "Must start with 'SKU-'"), check for specific keywords, or validate complex JSON structures.

```python
def validate(output, expected_output, **kwargs):
    # Example: Fail if specific forbidden words are present
    if "competitor_name" in output.lower():
        return {"score": 0, "result": "Fail", "reason": "Mentioned competitor"}
    return {"score": 1, "result": "Pass", "reason": "Clean output"}

```

#### API-Based Evaluators
Connect your evaluation pipeline to external systems. If you have an existing scoring service or a specialized compliance API, you can wrap it as a Custom Evaluator to maintain a unified quality view within Maxim.

## Human-in-the-Loop Evaluations

For high-stakes validation or subjective quality assessment, Maxim provides a robust **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)** pipeline. This allows subject matter experts (SMEs), domain specialists, or internal team members to review AI outputs alongside automated metrics.

### Annotation Methods

Maxim supports two primary workflows for collecting human feedback:

| Method | Best For | How it Works |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Annotate on Report** | Internal Teams | Team members with Maxim access can directly rate entries within the test run report. Multiple team members can rate the same entry, and the platform calculates the average score. |
| **Send via Email** | External SMEs & Clients | Send evaluation requests to external reviewers (e.g., doctors, lawyers) via email. They receive a secure link to a Rater Dashboard where they can review outputs without needing a paid Maxim seat. |

## Best Practices

- **Curate from Production:** Use [Data Curation](https://www.getmaxim.ai/docs/library/datasets/curate-datasets) to turn failed production traces into test cases for your offline datasets.
- **Test Tool Use:** Specifically for agents, use the [Tool Call Accuracy evaluator](https://www.getmaxim.ai/docs/library/evaluators/pre-built-evaluators/statistical-evaluators/tool-call-accuracy) to verify that your agent selects the correct tools and parameters.
- **Use Synthetic Data:** If you lack test data, use [Synthetic Data Generation](https://www.getmaxim.ai/docs/library/datasets/synthetic-data-generation) to create datasets with edge cases and diverse user inputs.
