title: "How can I Evaluate My RAG Application?"
description: "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) evaluation measures the quality of both the retrieved context and the generated output in a RAG system. It uses metrics like answer correctness, relevance, semantic similarity, context recall, and faithfulness to assess how well the system retrieves and uses information to generate responses."
