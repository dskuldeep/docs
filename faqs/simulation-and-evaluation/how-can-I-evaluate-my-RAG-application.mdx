title: "How can I Evaluate My RAG Application?"
description: "Evaluating a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application goes beyond measuring individual component performance. A comprehensive evaluation assesses your entire system including user experience, reliability, cost efficiency, and business value delivery. Effective RAG application evaluation ensures your system meets real-world user needs and business objectives."

## Maxim AI's RAG Application Evaluation Capabilities

Maxim AI provides comprehensive tools for RAG application evaluation:

- **Automated Testing Infrastructure**: Run systematic tests measuring metrics across all evaluation dimensions
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Track performance on production traffic with comprehensive dashboards
- **Component-Level Analysis**: Separately evaluate retrieval and generation to pinpoint issues
- **A/B Testing Framework**: Compare different RAG configurations with controlled rollouts
- **Custom Evaluation Metrics**: Define application-specific success criteria beyond standard metrics
- **Hallucination Detection**: Automatically identify and flag responses containing unsupported claims
- **Cost Analytics**: Track and optimize operational costs with detailed breakdowns
- **User Feedback Integration**: Collect and analyze user feedback to complement automated metrics
- **Alerting**: Get notified when key metrics degrade or anomalous patterns emerge
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Investigate failures systematically to understand performance issues

## Best Practices

- **Evaluate Continuously**: Monitor production performance continuously to catch degradation early
- **Test Like Users**: Build test sets from real user queries and behaviors
- **Balance Metrics**: Don't over-optimize for a single metric; balance accuracy, speed, cost, and user experience
- **Measure What Matters**: Focus on metrics that align with user needs and business goals
- **Combine Perspectives**: Use automated metrics, LLM judges, human review, and user feedback together
- **Version Everything**: Track evaluation results alongside system versions
