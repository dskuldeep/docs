- **AI-based Evaluators**: Build LLM-as-judge evaluators using different models and parameters based on your requirements. 
- **Human Evaluators**: Set up human raters to review and assess AI outputs, capturing nuanced quality control across the full lifecycle.
- **Programmatic/API-based Evaluators**: Integrate code-based or API-driven checks for objective, deterministic assessments.
Maxim allows teams to version custom evaluators to tune outcomes and align them to human preferences as AI agents evolve.
Maxim provides a collection of pre-built evaluators in the Evaluator Store that you can use immediately for your AI evaluation needs. These include high-quality evaluators from Maxim and popular third-party evaluators like Google, Vertex, OpenAI.
