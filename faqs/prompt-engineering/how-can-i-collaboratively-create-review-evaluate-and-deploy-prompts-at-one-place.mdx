title: " How can I Collaboratively Create, Review, Evaluate and Deploy Prompts at One Place?"
description: "Maxim provides a comprehensive prompt management platform where teams can collaboratively work on prompts throughout their entire lifecycle. The platform combines prompt playground, versioning, sessions, evaluations, and deployment capabilities in a unified interface."

## Collaborative Prompt Development

Prompt sessions enable teams to save and share their complete playground state as they experiment:

- **Save your work**: Sessions capture variable values, conversation messages, and all configuration details with timestamps and creator information
- **Team collaboration**: Tag sessions with descriptive names to provide context about specific use cases, making it easy for others to understand and build upon previous work
- **Quick access**: Use keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+S or Ctrl+S) to save sessions quickly, and view recent sessions directly from the prompt header

## Testing and Evaluation

Run comprehensive evaluations against curated datasets using Maxim's suite of pre-built or custom evaluators:

- Compare different prompt versions side-by-side
- Measure quality metrics like accuracy, relevance, and coherence
- Track performance metrics such as latency and cost
- Support both automated testing pipelines and human-in-the-loop review processes

## Version Control and Deployment

Maxim maintains a complete history of prompt versions, allowing you to track changes, compare performance across iterations, and roll back if needed. When ready to deploy, push approved prompt versions to production through Maxim's deployment system, which integrates with your CI/CD workflows to ensure only validated prompts reach your users.
