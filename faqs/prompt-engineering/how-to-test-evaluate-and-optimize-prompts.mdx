## Quick Testing in the Playground

Start by running your prompt interactively in the [Prompt Playground](https://www.getmaxim.ai/docs/offline-evals/via-ui/prompts/prompt-playground) to validate basic behavior. You can configure different models, adjust parameters like temperature and max tokens, and test various inputs. For multi-turn conversations, add messages and mimic assistant responses to debug complex interactions. Save your experimental states as [sessions](https://www.getmaxim.ai/docs/offline-evals/via-ui/prompts/prompt-sessions) so you can return to them later or share them with team members.

## Running Evaluations Against Datasets

For systematic quality measurement, [run your prompt against a dataset](https://www.getmaxim.ai/docs/offline-evals/via-ui/prompts/quickstart) of test cases with evaluators attached:

- **Choose a dataset** containing your test inputs and expected outputs
- **Select evaluators** from the Evaluator Store to measure dimensions like accuracy, toxicity, relevance, or custom criteria
- **Review comprehensive reports** showing overall quality scores, which inputs performed best or worst, side-by-side comparisons of expected vs. actual outputs, and detailed evaluator feedback on specific responses

## Comparing Prompt Versions

When iterating on prompts, use [comparison evaluations](https://www.getmaxim.ai/docs/offline-evals/via-ui/prompts/prompt-evals) to make data-driven decisions:

- Compare different prompt versions or entirely different prompts against the same dataset
- Analyze scores across all test cases for your chosen evaluation metrics
- Review side-by-side output differences along with latency, cost, and token usage charts
- Deep-dive into any entry to inspect messages, evaluation details, and logs

## Evaluating Tool Call Accuracy

For agentic workflows, Maxim lets you measure whether your prompt [selects the correct tools](https://www.getmaxim.ai/docs/offline-evals/via-ui/prompts/tool-calls):

- Attach tools (API, code, or schema) to your prompt in the Playground
- Create a dataset with inputs and expected tool calls
- Use the tool call accuracy evaluator to score whether the model chose the right tools with correct arguments
- Review detailed message logs showing the complete tool selection and execution flow

## Testing RAG and Retrieval Quality

For prompts that rely on retrieved context, connect your RAG pipeline via a Context Source and [evaluate retrieval quality](https://www.getmaxim.ai/docs/offline-evals/via-ui/prompts/retrieval):

- Link your retrieval API endpoint as a dynamic variable in your prompt
- Run evaluations with context-specific evaluators like context recall, context precision, and context relevance
- Examine retrieved chunks for each test case and review evaluator reasoning to debug retrieval issues

## MCP Integration for Tool-Assisted Workflows

If you're using Model Context Protocol, Maxim supports both agentic and non-agentic modes for [testing prompts with MCP tools](https://www.getmaxim.ai/docs/offline-evals/via-ui/prompts/mcp). Connect your MCP client, attach the tools to your prompt, and evaluate whether the model correctly leverages them across different scenarios.

## AI-Powered Prompt Optimization

After running evaluations, use Maxim's [prompt optimization](https://www.getmaxim.ai/docs/offline-evals/via-ui/prompts/prompt-optimization) to automatically improve your prompts:

- Select which evaluators to prioritize and how many optimization iterations to run
- The system analyzes your test results, generates improved prompt versions, and tests them against your dataset
- Review side-by-side comparisons of original and optimized prompts with detailed reasoning for each change
- Accept the optimized version to create a new prompt version linked to your evaluation runs

This combination of interactive testing, automated evaluation, and AI-assisted optimization helps you systematically improve prompt quality before deploying to production.
