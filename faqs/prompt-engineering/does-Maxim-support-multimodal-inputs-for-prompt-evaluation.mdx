title: "Does Maxim Support Multimodal Inputs for Prompt Evaluation?"
description: "Yes, Maxim AI supports [evaluating prompts](https://www.getmaxim.ai/docs/offline-evals/via-ui/prompts/prompt-evals) with multimodal inputs across both the Prompt Playground for interactive experimentation and Evaluation Runs for batch testing. You can iterate on prompts using diverse data types (including text, images, audio, and documents) directly in the [Prompt Playground](https://www.getmaxim.ai/docs/offline-evals/via-ui/prompts/prompt-playground). For scale, you can run Evaluation Runs against datasets containing multimodal fields, ensuring your prompts perform consistently."
