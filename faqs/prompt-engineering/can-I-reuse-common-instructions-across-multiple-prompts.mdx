title: "Can I Reuse Common Instructions Across Multiple Prompts?"
description: "Yes, you can leverage [Prompt Partials](https://www.getmaxim.ai/docs/library/prompt-partials#creating-prompt-partials) on Maxim. They are reusable snippets of prompt content such as tone guidelines, safety rules, or formatting instructions that can be created once and used across multiple prompts. Instead of rewriting the same instruction for every agent, teams define and version it centrally (e.g., <code>&#123;&#123;partials.brand-voice.v1&#125;&#125;</code>) and inject it wherever needed. "

With Maxim’s granular role-based access control, teams can ensure that only specific members can create and edit prompt partials, while the rest of the team uses them as part of [prompt experimentation](https://www.getmaxim.ai/docs/offline-evals/via-ui/prompts/prompt-playground). This enables effective collaboration across teams, especially between engineering and product, while ensuring the integrity of prompt components that should not be modified by all team members.
