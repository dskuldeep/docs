title: "What is Prompt Engineering?"
description: "Prompt engineering is the practice of writing clear and effective instructions that guide LLMs to produce outputs that meet your requirements. Models are non-deterministic and may return different results for the same input. Carefully crafting and iterating on prompts is essential to ensure that responses reliably meet quality, safety, and business requirements."

With Maxim's prompt management platform, you can operationalize this entire process at scale. You can iterate, version, and evaluate prompts across models, parameters, tools, etc. You can run these experiments against an eval dataset on metrics you care for, and automate this process to catch regressions/make improvements, all while ensuring seamless cross-functional collaboration and rapid experimentation.
