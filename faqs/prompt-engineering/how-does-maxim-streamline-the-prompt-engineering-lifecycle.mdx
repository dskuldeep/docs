## Experimentation & Rapid Iteration

The [Prompt Playground](https://www.getmaxim.ai/docs/offline-evals/via-ui/prompts/prompt-playground) provides a dedicated environment for testing and refining prompts:

- **Multi-model testing:** Experiment across open-source, closed, and custom models, adjusting parameters like temperature and max tokens
- **Side-by-side comparison:** Compare up to five prompts or versions simultaneously, analyzing outputs, latency, cost, and token usage
- **Tool and MCP integration:** Attach [tools](https://www.getmaxim.ai/docs/offline-evals/via-ui/prompts/tool-calls) (API, code, or schema) and connect [MCP servers](https://www.getmaxim.ai/docs/offline-evals/via-ui/prompts/mcp) to test agentic workflows
- **RAG pipeline testing:** Connect your [retrieval pipeline](https://www.getmaxim.ai/docs/offline-evals/via-ui/prompts/retrieval) via Context Sources to test prompts with real retrieved context
- **Session management:** [Save, tag, and recall](https://www.getmaxim.ai/docs/offline-evals/via-ui/prompts/prompt-sessions) full playground states, including variable values and conversation history, so you never lose an experiment

## Organization & Governance

Treat prompts as managed assets with a centralized Prompt CMS:

- **Prompt versioning:** Every change is tracked with author and timestamp. [Publish versions](https://www.getmaxim.ai/docs/offline-evals/via-ui/prompts/prompt-versions), view diffs between them, and roll back to a known-good state if needed
- **Prompt Partials:** Create reusable snippets for recurring instructions (safety guidelines, output formats, etc.) and inject them using simple syntax like `{{partials.tone-and-structure.latest}}`. This ensures teams use standardized, approved language across prompts
- **Folders and tags:** Organize prompts systematically as your library grows
- **Role-based access control:** Control who can view, edit, or deploy prompts at the workspace level

## Evaluation & Quality Measurement

Move beyond manual testing with systematic, data-driven evaluation:

- **Dataset-driven testing:** [Run prompts against datasets](https://www.getmaxim.ai/docs/offline-evals/via-ui/prompts/quickstart) of test cases with evaluators attached to measure accuracy, toxicity, relevance, and custom criteria
- **Comparison reports:** [Compare prompt versions](https://www.getmaxim.ai/docs/offline-evals/via-ui/prompts/prompt-evals) at scale, analyzing scores across all test cases to make informed decisions and prevent regressions
- **Tool call accuracy:** Measure whether your prompts select the correct tools with correct arguments for agentic workflows
- **Retrieval quality:** Evaluate context precision, recall, and relevance to identify and fix RAG pipeline issues
- **Human-in-the-loop:** Set up annotation pipelines for qualitative review alongside automated evaluators

## Optimization & Deployment

Close the loop from experimentation to production:

- **AI-powered optimization:** Use Maxim's [prompt optimizer](https://www.getmaxim.ai/docs/offline-evals/via-ui/prompts/prompt-optimization) to automatically analyze test results and generate improved prompt versions with detailed reasoning for each change
- **Decoupled deployment:** Deploy prompts directly from the UI with deployment variables, no code changes required. Product teams can push updates without waiting on engineering
- **SDK integration:** Query prompts programmatically via the Maxim SDK to dynamically retrieve version-controlled prompts in production

This end-to-end workflow enables teams to experiment freely, measure quality systematically, and deploy with confidence.
