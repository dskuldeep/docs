title: "Can I Build No-Code Agents and Chain Multiple Prompts for Exerimentation with Maxim?"
description: "Yes, Maxim enables you to build and experiment with complex agentic workflows using its [No-Code Agent Builder](https://www.getmaxim.ai/docs/offline-evals/via-ui/agents-via-no-code-builder/quickstart). This visual interface allows you to orchestrate multi-step logic without writing code by leveraging existing prompts from your [Prompt CMS](https://www.getmaxim.ai/docs/offline-evals/via-ui/prompts/prompt-playground). You can chain these prompts together on a canvas, mapping the output of one step to become the input variable for the next, and seamlessly integrate tool nodes (for API calls and function calls), code blocks (for custom scripts), and conditional logic. You can run evals on these end-to-end agents and deploy them directly from the platform."
