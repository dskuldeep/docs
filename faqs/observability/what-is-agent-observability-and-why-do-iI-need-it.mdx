title: "What is Agent Observability and Why do I Need It?"
description: "Observability is the practice of monitoring, tracing, and analyzing the internal states, decision-making processes, and outputs of AI agents in real-time. 
<br/>
<br/>
Maxim AI provides end-to-end visibility into your AI agent's performance by [tracing](https://www.getmaxim.ai/docs/tracing/overview) the complete request lifecycle. This includes context retrieval, tool and API calls, LLM requests and responses, and multi-turn conversation flows.
<br/>
<br/>
With this comprehensive tracing you can quickly identify failure modes, uncover edge cases, and diagnose root causes. You can also [set up real-time alerts](https://www.getmaxim.ai/docs/online-evals/set-up-alerts-and-notifications) to get notified of any regressions in quality or when performance metrics exceed defined thresholds in production.
