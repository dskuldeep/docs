title: "How can I Evaluate Voice Agents with Realistic Voice Simulations?"
description: "Voice agent evaluation requires testing real-world conversation scenarios to ensure your AI handles voice interactions naturally and appropriately. Maxim's Voice Simulation feature enables comprehensive testing of your voice agent's capabilities across different speech patterns, accents, and conversational scenarios without requiring live user interactions."

## Setting Up Voice Simulations

To get started with voice simulations in Maxim:

- **Add a voice provider**: Navigate to Settings > Voice Providers and configure your preferred provider (Twilio or VAPI) with the necessary account credentials for secure connection
- **Configure your voice agent**: Go to Agents > Voice Agents and create a new agent with its name, description, phone number, and country code
- **Define test scenarios**: Create custom scenarios that specify the conversation context, goals, and desired persona characteristics including voice style and behavior patterns
- **Set conversation flow**: Configure whether your simulation agent or voice agent initiates the conversation (default is simulation agent waiting for your voice agent to speak first)

## Evaluation Capabilities

Maxim's voice simulation runs provide comprehensive insights into your agent's performance:

- Real-time audio streaming and transcription for both simulation and voice agents
- Complete conversation transcripts displayed side-by-side for easy analysis
- Audio recordings available for playback and download
- Statistical conversation metrics including average response latency, average pitch, talk ratio, and speech rate
- Built-in voice evaluators to assess conversation quality across scenarios

This allows you to identify issues with response timing, conversation flow, and voice quality before deploying to production, ensuring your voice agent delivers consistent, high-quality interactions across diverse user scenarios.
