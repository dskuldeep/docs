title: "How can I Collect And Add User Feedback To A Trace?"
description: "Collecting user feedback is essential for understanding how well your AI application meets user expectations and identifying opportunities for improvement. Maxim's observability platform includes a built-in Feedback entity that allows you to capture structured user ratings and comments directly within your application traces, creating a direct link between user satisfaction and specific system behaviors."

## Implementing User Feedback

You can add feedback to traces using Maxim's SDK across multiple programming languages:

- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: `trace.feedback({ score: 5, comment: "Great job!" })`
- **Python**: `trace.feedback(score=5, comment="Great job!")`
- **Go and Java**: Similar methods available through respective SDKs

The feedback structure supports:

- Numerical scores (typically 1-5 or custom rating scales)
- Optional text comments for qualitative insights
- Association with specific traces for granular analysis

## Leveraging Feedback Data

Once feedback is collected, Maxim provides powerful analysis capabilities:

- View feedback directly in trace details alongside technical metrics like latency, token usage, and cost
- Filter and search traces based on user satisfaction scores to identify patterns
- Track average user feedback over time through the Overview tab's aggregated metrics
- Correlate user satisfaction with specific prompt versions, model choices, or system configurations
- Set up alerts when feedback scores drop below acceptable thresholds

This feedback loop enables data-driven improvements to your AI applications, helping you prioritize optimization efforts based on actual user experience rather than technical metrics alone.
