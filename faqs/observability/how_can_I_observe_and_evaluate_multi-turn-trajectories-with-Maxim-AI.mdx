title: "How can I Observe and Evaluate Multi-Turn Trajectories with Maxim AI?"
description: "Maxim lets you observe and evaluate multi-turn agent behavior using [Sessions](https://www.getmaxim.ai/docs/tracing/tracing-via-sdk/sessions), which represent end-to-end task executions.
<br/>
<br/>
Each session groups together all traces generated across multiple turns, giving you a complete view of how context evolves as the agent plans, reasons, performs actions, and responds over time. This makes it easy to inspect the full trajectory rather than fragmented, single-turn logs.
<br/>
<br/>
On top of sessions, you can attach evaluators such as task success, trajectory quality, or custom agent metrics to measure their real-world performance. These evaluations can be monitored over time and used to detect regressions, unexpected behaviors, or quality drops in production.
