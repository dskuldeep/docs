## LiveKit Integration

For voice agents built with LiveKit, Maxim offers a streamlined integration:

- **One-line setup**: Instrument your entire LiveKit agent with `instrument_livekit(logger, on_event)`
- **Automatic tracing**: Captures agent conversations, function tool calls, and performance metrics in real-time
- **Complete transcripts**: Records system instructions, user messages, and assistant responses
- **Framework support**: Works seamlessly with both OpenAI Realtime and Gemini models within LiveKit

## OpenAI Realtime API Integration

Maxim supports direct integration with OpenAI's Realtime API:

- **Minimal code changes**: Use the `MaximOpenAIClient` wrapper to enable comprehensive observability
- **Session enrichment**: Add custom session names, tags, and IDs through additional headers
- **Complete traces**: Captures multi-turn conversations, tool calls with arguments and results, plus detailed timing and cost metrics

## Continuous Evaluation

Once integrated, run continuous evaluations on your voice agent recordings and transcripts using specialized voice evaluators:

- Abrupt disconnection detection
- Signal-to-noise ratio measurement
- Sentiment analysis
- User satisfaction tracking
- Word error rate (WER) calculation

Combined with Maxim's observability suite, you can identify conversation patterns, debug performance issues, and continuously improve your voice agents based on real interaction data.
