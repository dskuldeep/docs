title: "Best Prompt Versioning Platform: Maxim vs Braintrust"
description: "Maxim AI and Braintrust both offer robust prompt versioning capabilities, but with different approaches. Maxim provides an end-to-end platform that integrates prompt versioning with experimentation, evaluation, simulation, and observability, making it ideal for teams building production-grade AI agents. Braintrust focuses on evaluation-first development with environment-based deployment and content-addressable versioning. This comparison examines features, pricing, and use cases to help you choose the right platform."

## Introduction

[Prompt versioning](https://www.getmaxim.ai/articles/prompt-versioning-and-its-best-practices-2025/) has become critical infrastructure for teams building production AI applications. Without systematic version control, teams face operational risks including silent performance degradation, difficulty in cross-functional collaboration, and inability to roll back to known-good states when issues arise.

Both Maxim AI and Braintrust address these challenges but through fundamentally different platform architectures and workflows.

## What is Prompt Versioning?

Prompt versioning applies software version control principles to prompt engineering workflows. Instead of editing prompts directly in production code or making ad-hoc changes without tracking, teams implement systematic processes that:

- **Record every prompt modification** with timestamps, authors, and descriptions
- **Preserve historical versions** for rollback and audit trails
- **Enable A/B testing** and controlled rollouts using labels or rules
- **Support evaluation at scale** across datasets and metrics
- **Maintain deployment separation** between dev, staging, and production environments

### Braintrust

[Braintrust](https://www.braintrust.dev/) focuses on evaluation-first development with systematic testing workflows. The platform treats prompts as versioned, first-class artifacts integrated into complete development workflows. Braintrust emphasizes environment-based deployment and quality gates before production.

**Core Capabilities:**
- Evaluation-first approach with automated quality scoring
- Environment-based versioning (dev, staging, production)
- Content-addressable prompt storage
