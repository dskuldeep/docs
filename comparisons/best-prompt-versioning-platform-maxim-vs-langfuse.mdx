## What is Prompt Versioning?

[Prompt versioning](https://www.getmaxim.ai/articles/version-control-for-prompts-the-foundation-of-reliable-ai-workflows/) tracks changes to prompt templates across environments and teams, enabling safe iteration, impact measurement, and confident deployment. As AI applications scale in production, systematic prompt management becomes critical for maintaining reliability and reducing regressions.

Effective prompt versioning platforms enable:

- **Version control** with audit trails for each iteration
- **Cross-functional collaboration** between engineering and product teams
- **A/B testing** and controlled rollouts using labels or deployment rules
- **Evaluation at scale** across datasets and metrics
- **Production monitoring** with cost tracking and quality metrics
