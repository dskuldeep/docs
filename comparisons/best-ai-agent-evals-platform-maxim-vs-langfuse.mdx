title: "Best AI Agent Evals Platform: Maxim vs Langfuse"
description: "Maxim AI and Langfuse are both powerful AI agent evaluation platforms, but they serve different needs. Maxim AI is an end-to-end platform offering simulation, evaluation, and observability with strong cross-functional collaboration features. Langfuse is an open-source LLM engineering platform focused on tracing and observability. Choose Maxim AI for comprehensive agent testing, multi-turn simulations, and collaborative workflows across product and engineering teams. Choose Langfuse if you need an open-source solution with deep framework integrations and prefer self-hosting."

## Platform Overview

### Maxim AI

[Maxim AI](https://www.getmaxim.ai/) is an end-to-end AI simulation, evaluation, and observability platform designed to help teams ship AI agents reliably and 5x faster. The platform emphasizes cross-functional collaboration between engineering and product teams, offering a comprehensive toolkit that spans the entire AI application lifecycle from prompt engineering to production monitoring.

**Key Strengths:**
- Purpose-built for [agent simulation and evaluation](https://www.getmaxim.ai/products/agent-simulation-evaluation)
- No-code UI for product teams alongside powerful SDKs (Python, TypeScript, Java, Go)
- Multi-turn conversation simulation with custom personas
- Unified evaluation framework (AI, programmatic, statistical, human-in-the-loop)

### Langfuse

Langfuse is an open-source LLM engineering platform that helps teams collaboratively develop, monitor, evaluate, and debug AI applications. Built by developers for developers, Langfuse emphasizes transparency through open-source principles and offers robust self-hosting options alongside its cloud service.

**Key Strengths:**
- Fully open-source 
- Strong observability and tracing with OpenTelemetry standards
- Deep framework integrations (LangChain, LlamaIndex, OpenAI SDK)
- Flexible self-hosting or cloud deployment

## Agent Evaluation Capabilities

### Agent Tracing and Observability

Both platforms excel at [agent tracing](https://www.getmaxim.ai/articles/agent-tracing-for-debugging-multi-agent-ai-systems/), but with different approaches:

**Maxim AI:**
- Provides session-level, trace-level, and span-level observability
- Real-time alerts for production issues
- Supports distributed tracing across multi-agent systems
- Custom evaluation rules at any granularity level

**Langfuse:**
- Visualizes agent graphs to illustrate workflow execution
- Agent-specific UI with tool call rendering and log view
- Three evaluation levels: final response (black-box), trajectory (glass-box), and single step (white-box)
- Cost and latency tracking per agent step

### Multi-Turn Agent Testing

**Maxim AI** stands out for [agent simulation](https://www.getmaxim.ai/products/agent-simulation-evaluation) capabilities:
- Simulate thousands of scenarios with custom user personas
- Test agents across goal-driven dialogue paths
- Re-run simulations from any step to reproduce issues
- Parallel execution across multiple prompt variations

**Langfuse** offers:
- Dataset-based offline evaluation
- Manual trace inspection for debugging
- Online evaluation through user feedback mechanisms
- Support for multi-turn conversation tracking

### Evaluation Methods

Both platforms support comprehensive evaluation workflows, but with different strengths:

**Maxim AI:**
- [Pre-built evaluator store](https://www.getmaxim.ai/products/agent-simulation-evaluation) with custom evaluator creation
- Configurable evaluations at session, trace, or span level
- Managed human evaluation service on Enterprise plans
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines via SDK/API

**Langfuse:**
- [LLM-as-a-judge evaluation templates](https://langfuse.com/docs/evaluation/overview)
- User feedback collection (thumbs up/down)
- Manual labeling through annotation queue
- Experiment comparison with baseline/candidate analysis

### Cost Analysis

**For Small Teams (2-5 people):**
- **Maxim AI:** $58-145/month (Professional plan)
- **Langfuse:** Free-$59/month (depending on usage)

**For Growing Teams (10+ people):**
- **Maxim AI:** $290-490/month (Professional to Business)
- **Langfuse:** $499/month+ (Team or Enterprise for unlimited usage)

**Key Difference:** Maxim's seat-based pricing is predictable and scales with team size, while Langfuse's usage-based model can be more cost-effective for small teams with high observation volumes or more expensive for high-traffic applications.
