- Cross-functional collaboration between engineering and product teams
- Framework-agnostic design (works with any LLM framework)
- Built-in agent simulation capabilities
- Advanced prompt management with [Playground++](https://www.getmaxim.ai/products/experimentation)

### Langsmith

Langsmith is the official observability, testing, and evaluation platform for LangChain-powered applications. It provides visibility into agent execution, trace tracking, and prompt management.

**Key Strengths:**
- Deep integration with LangChain and LangGraph
- Polly AI assistant for agent debugging
- LangSmith Studio for agent visualization

## Core Debugging Features

| Feature | Maxim | Langsmith |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| **Distributed Tracing** | Sessions, traces, spans with multi-turn support | Runs, traces, threads with nested structure |
| **Real-time Debugging** | Live dashboards with custom views | Real-time monitoring with alerts |
| **AI-Powered Analysis** | Built-in evaluators and simulation | Polly AI assistant for trace analysis |
| **Step-by-Step Visibility** | LLM calls, tool usage, database queries, context retrieval | LLM calls, tool executions, model invocations |

### Agent Tracing

Both platforms provide comprehensive [agent tracing](https://www.getmaxim.ai/articles/agent-tracing-for-debugging-multi-agent-ai-systems/) capabilities, but with different approaches:

**Maxim's Approach:**
- **Sessions:** Track entire multi-turn conversations end-to-end
- **Traces:** Capture individual request-response interactions within sessions
- **Spans:** Break down traces into specific steps (LLM calls, tool usage, database queries)
- **Events:** Granular logging for custom debugging points

**Langsmith's Approach:**
- **Threads:** Full conversation between user and application
- **Traces:** Single execution of your agent
- **Runs:** Individual steps including LLM calls and tool executions
- **Base Traces (14-day retention)** vs **Extended Traces (400-day retention)**

## Prompt Versioning and Management

[Prompt versioning](https://www.getmaxim.ai/articles/prompt-management-in-2025-how-to-organize-test-and-optimize-your-ai-prompts/) is critical for maintaining and improving agent reliability. Here's how each platform handles it:

## Evaluation and Testing

Testing agents before production is crucial for [AI reliability](https://www.getmaxim.ai/articles/ai-reliability-how-to-build-trustworthy-ai-systems/).

| Capability | Maxim | Langsmith |
|------------|-------|-----------|
| **Pre-Production Testing** | AI-powered simulation across scenarios and personas | Dataset-based evaluation with LLM-as-Judge |
| **Evaluation Types** | AI, programmatic, statistical, and human evaluators | LLM-as-Judge evaluators with human feedback collection |
| **Granularity** | Session, trace, or span level | Trace level with annotation queues |
| **Human Evaluation** | Built-in human review workflows | Pairwise annotation queues for comparing outputs |
| **Simulation** | Test agents across thousands of scenarios | Limited to dataset-based testing |

## Final Thoughts

Both Maxim and Langsmith are powerful [agent debugging platforms](https://www.getmaxim.ai/articles/llm-observability-how-to-monitor-large-language-models-in-production/), but they serve different team needs. Maxim excels as a comprehensive, framework-agnostic platform that enables cross-functional collaboration and provides end-to-end coverage of the AI lifecycle. Langsmith shines for teams deeply embedded in the LangChain ecosystem who value tight integration and long-term trace retention.

For teams serious about [AI agent quality](https://www.getmaxim.ai/blog/ai-agent-quality-evaluation/) and reliability, the choice often comes down to whether you need a full-stack platform (Maxim) or a LangChain-optimized solution (Langsmith).
