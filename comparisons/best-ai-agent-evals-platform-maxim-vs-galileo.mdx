title: "Best AI Agent Evals Platform: Maxim vs Galileo"
description: "Both Maxim and Galileo offer robust AI agent evaluation platforms, but they differ in scope and approach. **Maxim** provides an end-to-end platform covering experimentation, simulation, evaluation, and observability with strong cross-functional collaboration features. **Galileo** focuses on evaluation foundation models (EFMs) and real-time guardrails powered by their Luna-2 small language models. Choose Maxim for comprehensive lifecycle management and team collaboration, or Galileo for cost-effective production monitoring."

## Evaluation Capabilities

### Maxim's Evaluation Approach

Maxim offers a **unified evaluation framework** supporting multiple evaluation types:

**Evaluator Types:**
- **AI-based evaluators:** LLM-as-a-judge for semantic quality
- **Programmatic evaluators:** Rule-based validation for structure and format
- **Statistical evaluators:** Quantitative metrics for performance analysis
- **Human evaluators:** SME review workflows for nuanced assessment

**Evaluation Levels:**
- Session-level evaluation (entire conversation quality)
- Trace-level evaluation (individual request-response quality)
- Span-level evaluation (component-specific metrics)

**Key Differentiators:**
- Pre-built [evaluator store](https://www.getmaxim.ai/docs/introduction/overview) with customization options
- Flexible evaluation at any granularity level
- Visual comparison across prompt versions
- Dataset curation from evaluation results
